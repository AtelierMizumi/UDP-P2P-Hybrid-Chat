# Shype P2P Chat System - Demo Instructions

## Overview
The system has been completely restructured to implement proper P2P networking:

1. **Login Server**: Manages user connections and maintains user list
2. **P2P Client Network**: Clients establish direct connections for messaging
3. **Automatic User List Updates**: When clients connect/disconnect, all other clients are notified

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd "/home/thuanc177/RiderProjects/Shype Login Server TCP/Shype Login Server TCP"
dotnet run
# Choose option: 1
```

### Step 2: Start Multiple Clients
Open multiple terminals and run:
```bash
cd "/home/thuanc177/RiderProjects/Shype Login Server TCP/Shype Login Server TCP"
dotnet run
# Choose option: 2
# Enter different usernames for each client (e.g., "alice", "bob", "cay")
```

### Step 3: Test P2P Messaging
In any client terminal:
- Type `/users` to see online users
- Type `@username message` to send direct P2P messages
- Example: `@cay alo`

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Centralized User Management
- Server maintains list of connected users with their P2P endpoints
- Broadcasts user list updates when users join/leave

### 2. Direct P2P Connections
- Clients establish direct TCP connections for messaging
- No server involvement in actual message delivery
- Reuses existing connections for efficiency

### 3. Connection Resilience
- Detects when P2P connections are lost
- Automatically updates user lists when clients disconnect
- Handles server shutdown gracefully

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- `OnMessageReceived`: When P2P messages arrive
- `OnUserListUpdated`: When server sends updated user list
- `OnUserDisconnected`: When P2P connections are lost

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Issues):
- Messages routed through server
- No automatic user list updates
- Connection failures not handled properly

### After (Fixed):
- Server only handles login/logout and user discovery
- Direct P2P messaging between clients
- Automatic user list synchronization
- Proper connection cleanup and notifications
